# UberEats

UberEats is a food delivery service platform inspired by the original UberEats. This project consists of a backend server built with **NestJS**, **PostgreSQL**, and **GraphQL**, while the frontend is developed using **ReactJS**. This platform allows users to browse restaurants, place orders, and track delivery status in real-time.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and securely manage their accounts.
- **Restaurant Browsing**: Users can view a list of available restaurants and their menus.
- **Order Placement**: Users can place orders with real-time price calculation.
- **Order Tracking**: Track the status of the order from the moment itâ€™s placed to its delivery.
- **Admin Panel**: Restaurant owners can manage their menus and orders.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **ReactJS**: Library for building the user interface
- **Apollo Client**: For managing GraphQL queries and caching
- **Styled Components** (optional): For styling React components

### Backend
- **NestJS**: Backend framework for building scalable server-side applications
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for data persistence
- **GraphQL**: Query language for API communication
- **TypeORM**: ORM for database modeling and querying

## Architecture

This project follows a **microservices-inspired architecture** with a clear separation between the frontend and backend, enabling efficient and isolated development for each part. 

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (>=14.x)
- **PostgreSQL** (>=13.x)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UberEats.git
   cd UberEats/backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure your `.env` file with your database and other environment variables.

4. Run the database migrations:

   ```bash
   npm run migration:run
   ```

5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory to specify your environment variables.

Example:

```env
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_USER=your_db_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DATABASE_NAME=ubereats
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

## Usage

- **Frontend**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.
- **Backend**: Access the GraphQL playground at `http://localhost:5000/graphql`.

## API Documentation

Detailed API documentation is available in the GraphQL Playground accessible through the backend.
